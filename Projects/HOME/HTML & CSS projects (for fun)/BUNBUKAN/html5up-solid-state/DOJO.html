								<h2>Dojo Etiquette</h2>
								<p>In traditional Martial Arts, the development of the whole person is more important that the technical prowess. Hence, the strict compliance of the dojo Etiquettes is fundamental for the development of budo spirit.</p>

                  <p>The Dojo is a sacred place where we train ourselves physically and mentally. The student should respect the Dojo and observe the following etiquettes.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li> The instructor is always addressed by the students as <strong>SENSEI</strong>. This word is translated as "he/she who has gone before". So whatever your instructor demands of you, he/she has already done before and understands the implications of the technique that you are being asked to carry out.</li>
                    <li> Within the realm of Karate Do, etiquette is sign of respect. It is respect from the student to the Sensei, from the Sensei to the students, respect to all practitioners in the Dojo and to the Dojo itself.</li>
                    <li> When entering or leaving the Dojo, stand in the doorway, face the front, bow and say "OSU/OSS". This represents a mark of respect.</li>
                    <li> When starting any training, you should always bow and say "<em><strong>Onegai Shimasu</strong></em>" meaning "<em>Please help me(for my training)</em>", clearly and cheerfully.</li>
                    <li> If you arrive late at the training, please kneel at the side of the entrance in <strong><em>SEIZA</em></strong> (formal kneeling position) facing the <em>Kamiza</em>(front). When the Sensei acknowledges you, stand up and say "<em><strong>Shitsurei Shimasu</strong></em>"(excuse me for disturbing), then quickly join in the class.</li>
                    <li> When Sensei calls for "<strong>Rei</strong>", always bow with respect and say <strong><em>Domo-Arigato Gozaimashita</em></strong>.</li>
                    <li> Always pay respect to everybody in the dojo and remember to thank your senior student who gives you advice on Karate.</li>
                    <li> Do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in the Dojo.</li>
                    <li> Do not break rank for any reason, without asking for permission from the instructor. If you must leave your position, do not walk between the instructor and the class. Walk behind the row you are in to either side and proceed from there.</li>
                    <li> Always address the instructor and seniors by their proper title <em>(SEMPAI, SENSEI, SHIHAN) inside the Dojo. Acknowledge them with a loud "<strong>OSU</strong>" when they speak to you.</em></li>
                    <li> Do not talk in the Dojo unless you are invited to do so by the Sensei</li>
                    <li> Your training should be a serious matter. Do not laugh, giggle, talk or cause disruption during the class. You should always stand in <strong><em>Heiko Dachi</em></strong> when listening to the Sensei or awaiting the next instruction.</li>
                    <li> All instructions from the Sensei should be executed properly without any question or comment. You will not be asked to do anything that your Sensei has not done him/herself already. If you cannot keep up, do the best you can.</li>
                    <li> Always keep fingernails and toenails short and clean.</li>
                    <li> If there is any break in moving from type of technique to another, no sitting on chairs, leaning against the wall or strolling in the Dojo is allowed.</li>
                    <li> If you arrive early in the Dojo, start practicing your techniques.</li>
                    <li> It is everyone's responsibility to ensure that the Dojo is clean, tidy and safe at all times.</li>
                    <li> Your Karate-Gi must be neat and washed clean at all times. Your belt should <strong>NEVER</strong> be washed, only aired dry. It symbolically contains the spirit of your hard training, and under no circumstances are male practitioners allowed to wear t-shirts or other clothing underneath their Karate-Gi.</li>
                    <li> Do not practice <strong>KUMITE</strong> unless instructed to do so.</li>
                    <li> Don't wear jewellery or watches during training.</li>
                    <li> If you wish to leave the Dojo when training is still under way, ask for permission from the Sensei.</li>
                    <li> If you have an injury or just sustained one during the training, you must report it to the Sensei or a senior student.</li>
                    <li> Remember the Dojo is a special place and behave accordingly.</li>
                    <li> When the training is over, all students must follow the closing ceremony and sit in Seiza as long as necessary.</li>
                    <li> After the training, all students must fold their Gi in the traditional manner as per our school.</li>
                    <li> When the Sensei calls for "<strong><em>seiza</em></strong>", ensure that you sit in the SEIZA kneeling form. Place your hands on your lap.</li>
                    <li> When the Sensei calls "<strong><em>MUKUSO!</em></strong>"(means meditation), close your eyes, breathe deeply from the lower stomach, concentrate on the <strong><em>TAN DEN</em></strong>(the navel a few inches below the belly button), and try to achieve concentration.</li>
                    <li> While practicing, listen carefully and seriously the advice and instructions given to you.</li>
                    <li> When you use the training equipment, handly it with care, and ensure to put it back in the correct place after using it.</li>
                    <li> When leaving the Dojo, bow and say: "<strong><em>Domo-Arigato Gozaimashita</em></strong>" or "<strong><em>Shitsurei Shimasu</em></strong>"</li>
