								<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
								<p>The school is run as a non-profit association affiliated to the Institute of Classical Japanese Budo Culture which was formed by Shihan Chris Rowen after the passing of late Hanshi Gogen Yamaguichi. Bunbukan was formed in the early 1990s to preserve and pass on certain elements of the wonderful art of Goju Ryu Karate-Do and related aspects.</p>
								<p>The Japanese term "Bunbu" is a  concept used to describe the essential and ultimate balance required within arts and 'kan' refers to a place. So 'Bunbukan' translates as a place where the nature of 'bunbu' is sought, practised, studied and preserved. The institute's main mission is to promote budo culture to anyone who has an interest in traditional martial arts. The prime philosophy of the school is to disseminate knowledge, so it can be fostered and shared with anyone who wants to understand the essence of martial art.</p>
